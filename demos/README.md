# How to run the scripts
Before you begin, please read the [Legal](#Legal) section.

To run a recipe script, click a link in the table below from your target machine. This will download the Boxstarter one-click application, and prompt you for Boxstarter to run with Administrator privileges (which it needs to do its job). Clicking yes in this dialog will cause the recipe to begin. You can then leave the job unattended and come back when it's finished.

## Customize the scripts
These scripts should cover a lot of what you need but will not likely match your personal preferences exactly. In this case please fork the project and change the scripts however you desire. We really appreciate PR's back to this project if you have recommended changes.

*Note: The one-click links use the following format.  When working out of a different Fork or Branch you'll want to update the links as follows:*

`http://boxstarter.org/package/url?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GITHUB_DOMAIN/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts/YOUR_BRANCH/demos/RECIPE_NAME.ps1
`
